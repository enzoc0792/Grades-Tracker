# Grades Tracker

This is a program that creates a grades tracker for a school
Modelled loosely based on the grading system in Ateneo de Manila University, following letter grades (A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, and F)
The system can add students, teachers, subjects, classrooms, school years, and semesters. As of now, there are only a few webpages working which allow the user to add names of students and teachers.
